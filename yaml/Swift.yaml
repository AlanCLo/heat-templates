Description: "Template to show Swift in action"

# If you upload the file index.html into the resultant container, naming it 'index.html',
# and the output url will return it.
# However, if you forget to delete index.html from the container before you delete the stack,
# the container will remain behind. A bug, a feature or a safeguard?
